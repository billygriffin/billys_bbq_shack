== README

Billy's BBQ Shack is aiming for Southern Chic ambiance, and the website should give off that same vibe.

This was programmed using Ruby 2.0.0 and Rails 4.

We use better_errors for debugging, and Capybara for testing.

The database is a sqlite3 database for testing and dev, but dev and production will become PostgreSQL when we push it live.

We use rake for testing, so just run rake test from the root directory and you'll be good to go.

Things to possibly add to README:

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions
